## Hi, I'm Nicole

I'm a developer focused on building projects with Python.

- Python: APIs, automation, and backend projects  
- Java: Android apps and fundamentals  
- Strong QA background, with a focus on writing reliable and well-tested code  

### Currently exploring
- Go  
- Javascript/Typescript
- Docker and containerization  
- Kubernetes and cloud concepts  

Learning by building and experimenting.
